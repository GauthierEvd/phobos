# This scripts shows how phobos could be used in parallel on two servers by
# executing the following steps:
# - create a file on each server,
# - put the two files into phobos in parallel by asking separately each server
# to put its own file into phobos,
# - getting back the two file in parallel by asking separately each server to
# to get back its own file,
# - focus on the need of a future "relocate" call by asking to server1 to get
# back the file put on server0,
# - deletes files on each server.
# (TO BE DONE: delete example files from phobos)

# This scripts needs a running phobos on two servers sharing the same phobos
# database. The two phobos servers need dir devices ready to store a 1k file.
# This script must be run on a node able to connect by ssh to the both servers.
