Description: Local Resource Scheduler

C library: libphobos_lrs

Interfaces :
    - Receive local client requests (from the network layer).
      (v00: direct call from object store)
    - Receive local admin requests (from the network layer)
      (v00: 'phobos' command line directly access the DB).
    - Call LDM primitives for device control.
    - Call DRS to get/set persistent reservation info.
    - (not in v00) Send signals to local processes (admin purpose)

Client calls :
    - write-intent(size, layout)
        returns when the required resources are ready for local writing
        returns locations to write the objects
    - read-intent(layout & extents)
        returns when required resources are ready for local access
        returns a pointer to a location ready for reading
    - done(res_info_update)
        notifies the resource is no longer in use
        updates resource information (free space...)

Admin calls (online):
    - (not in v00) release(resource, flags)
        ask to release a resource (prior to admin locking)
        example of flags: kill processes currently accessing the resource
    - (not in v00) dump-status[resource]
        return the current usage information for a given resource (queue, usage,
        locking, ...)

Internals:
    - Phobos "brain"
    - (not in v00) Update resource status on startup + recover previous reservations
      (v00) load drive status
    - Manage concurrent access to resources (v00: 1 big lock)
    - (not in v00) Maintains queues per resource 
    - (not in v00) Schedule requests
