# File management

We changed how the file names on the media are written between version 1.95 and
2.0. It was changed from "oid.version.layout\_tag.object\_uuid" to
"oid.extent\_uuid".

The goal is to make the name more generic by removing the layout tag, as it
should be chosen and set by the io module, without regard to the layout used.

Moreover, this change keeps the name unique as we use the extent uuid, which is
generated by the standard uuid-generation methods, and is unique to each extent.

The rest of the information which were available with the previous name are
added as extended attributes to the file, alongside more information like the
layout used, and per-layout information like the replica count of the raid1
layout.
