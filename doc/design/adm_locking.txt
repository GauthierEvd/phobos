Administrative locking consists in tagging a resource (device, media...) to
ensure no operation is started on this resource. This is basically used in case
of a resource failure, if handling of a media represent a risk of loosing
data on it, or if a media has been moved out of the system (e.g. tape on
shelf). ADMINISTRATIVE LOCKING IS DIFFERENT FROM RESOURCE LOCKING THAT IS
USED TO MANAGE CONCURRENT ACCESS TO RESOURCES.

Administrative locking is lazy. It only ensures that the resource will
not be selected to perform new I/O operations but it does not cancel
current operations (only the concurrent locking system ensures an exclusive
access to the resources).

Administrative locking is implemented as an 'adm_status' enum field in
'device' and 'media' tables. This enum can take the following values:
* unlocked: the resource can be used.
* locked: the resource has been locked by an administrator.
* failed: the resource has been automatically locked by the system because of
  too many failures.

A 'locked' or 'failed' resource is never used for put/get operations.

A 'locked' or 'failed' resource is not used for administrative operations
(like format), unless the administrator explicitly force using it.

Example: drive 'E143DB0006' (named 'l5-dr0') is locked

    # this command gets another drive to format the tapes
    > phobos tape format 'T000[01-15]L5'

    # this command returns an error
    >  phobos tape format 'T000[01-15]L5' -d 'l5-dr0'
    Error: Drive 'l5-dr0' (S/N 'E143DB0006') is locked by admin.

    # this command force using the specified drive
    >  phobos tape format 'T0000[01-15]L5' -d 'l5-dr0' --force
    Warning: Using locked drive 'l5-dr0' (S/N 'E143DB0006').

Admin commands allow locking/unlocking resources:
> phobos drive {lock|unlock} 'l5-dr0'
> phobos tape {lock|unlock}  'T00001L5'
