Python modules and application

Phobos Application :
    - phobos [options] <object> <verb>

Libraries :
    The application mostly relies on the `phobos' module, which itself is
    divided into submodules. Some are raw, partly autogenerated, bindings
    over the C APIs (see `generating bindings' below). Others are pure python
    modules which expose object oriented interfaces for use in the
    application.

Generating bindings :
    - Low level bindings are grouped in a python submodule called 'capi'.
      Direct use from applications is to be avoided.
    - Some bindings (noted as *_module.c) have been written manually.
    - Others, for which we only have an interface (*.i file) are generated by
      SWIG as follows:

      $ swig -python -I../../include <component>.i
        --> Will generate the <component>_wrap.c and <component>.py files
      $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        --> Build the .so extensions corresponding to <component>_wrap.c and
            <component>_module.c
