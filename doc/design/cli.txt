Description: Command Line Interpreter

Python modules and application

Phobos Application :
    - phobos [options] <object> <verb>

Libraries :
    The application mostly relies on the `phobos` module, which itself is
    divided into submodules. Some are low level bindings over the C APIs
    (using python's C API and `ctypes`), and others are pure python modules
    which expose object oriented interfaces for use in the application.
