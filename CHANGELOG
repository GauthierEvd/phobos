# CHANGELOG UPDATES

## Ongoing

* The "phobos xxx lock" API has changed: '--force' option is removed. The option
was only considered with devices, so removing it for media will not alter its
behavior.
* The "phobos drive lock" API has changed: '--wait' option is added. Its
behavior is the same as the previous '--force' option.

## 1.94

* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to send
multiple format requests in a single call. The medium id provided thus becomes
an array of medium ids, and the length of that array is added as a parameter.

* The "phobos_admin_format" API function has been modified to be able to limit
the number of concurrent format sent to the phobosd. A "nb_streams" parameter
is added to the parameters of the function, with 0 signifying "send all requests
at once".

## 1.93

* The "simple" layout is no longer available. It cannot be used through the CLI
and will not be recognized in the API anymore. Instead, an alias has been
provided in the default template.conf, emulating the "simple" layout behaviour.
The layout used is "raid1", with a replica count set to 1.
