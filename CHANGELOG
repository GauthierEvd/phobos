# CHANGELOG UPDATES

## 1.93

* The "simple" layout is no longer available. It cannot be used through the CLI
and will not be recognized in the API anymore. Instead, an alias has been
provided in the default template.conf, emulating the "simple" layout behaviour.
The layout used is "raid1", with a replica count set to 1.
