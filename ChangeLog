Detailed list of changes since phobos 1.0:
----------

    scripts: phobos 1.0 to 1.1 DB conversion

    Adds a simple script 'pho_convert_db_10to11.sh' to convert DB schema
    from phobos 1.0 to phobos 1.1.


----------

    doc/config: add store's 'layout' parameter to config template

    Add store's 'layout' parameter to config template.
    This parameter determines which layout must be used for put operations.


----------

    layout: implement replication module

    Add raid1 module that replicates an object N times across N media.

    Rework test_store slightly so that the test suite can invoke it repeatedly using
    different layouts.

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-58

----------

    Fix dead code in test_store.sh

    The GET tests were not executed because the extents were deleted before the
    test had any chance to browse and check them.


----------

    common: implement pho_ht_foreach

    new iterator over entries of a GHashTable that can be interrupted by
    a callback returning a non-zero value. Such a value is propagated back
    to the caller.


----------

    common: add comments to the SAJ module

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-135

----------

    ldm: fix memory leak

    unconditionally release result of realpath() and manually
    assign errno in case a function fails w/o setting it.


----------

    Retrieve fs label at format and check it at mount

    Make sure that a filesystem (especially LTFS) that was mounted is the expected
    one. Achieve this by (optionally) comparing the FS label at mount time against
    the one stored in DSS, retrieved after formatting the medium.

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-57

----------

    Introduce FS label field into media_info

    Introduce a new fs_label field into DSS media description.
    Group filesystem related informations into a struct media_fs.

    This value (null-terminated, possibly empty) string will be used to
    compare the expected value to what is actually mounted to ensure system
    safety.

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-57

----------

    Introduce .fs_get_label in LDM fs operations

    Allow LDM callers to retrieve the label of a mounted filesystem.

    Use the ltfs.volumeName xattr facility for LTFS and a hidden file for
    POSIX.

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-57

----------

    doc: fix file mode

    Remove executable bit that was set by mistake


----------

    ldm: fix typo in comment


----------

    scripts: indentation fixes in pho_*_helper

    Replaced all tabs by spaces for consistency.


----------

    dss: prevent printf from receiving null params


----------

    layout: introduce new layout management layer

    Layout modules are autonomous implementations of a given layout type.
    They abstract actual object layouts by translating data xfer requests
    into corresponding storage resources and manipulation.

    Although the layout code is interleaved with the store state machine, layout
    can be seen as an interface between store and {LRS, IO}.

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-121

----------

    lrs: tag unwritable media as full

    LTFS has been observed to mount almost-full tapes as read-only. When
    this happens, tag the media as full and retry. Update LRS device
    selection logic accordingly.

    One  problem we have here is that there is no easy way to identify
    R/O-FS before linux 2.6.36 (ie. before RHEL7). Therefore, only rhel7
    will benefit from early detection. Older platforms will have to go
    through mput and watch it fail.

    If at least one slice of an mput fails with impossibility to further
    write on the media we mark the media as full.  Note that no retry is
    attempted at this step.

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-129

----------

    lib scsi: search a free slot to unload drive if none is specified

    In some cases (e.g. after library power reset) the library doesn't provide
    a source slot number for tapes loaded in drives.
    In this case, we must search for an empty slot where the tape can be moved.

    Completed test_scsi to check this case.
    Also fixed it to properly handle drive serials.


----------

    tests: add status check in test_scsi

    Check that the drive or slot status after a move_medium operation
    is the expected one.

    Also handle the case when no tape is seen in the library (neither
    in slots nor in drives).


----------

    lrs: added extra information to log message.

    Add the available size on a media to a verbose level log message
    so we can better keep track of space-related issues.


----------

    lrs: release device on write-prepare failure

    A device was allocated by the get_write_res() function that must
    be released on error.


----------

    ldm: used signed types to represent media space

    Both are big enough to not overflow but unsigned types can easily
    lead to miscalculation of available space if a difference returns
    a "negative" result.

    This has been observed in the 5% margin calculation, in
    ldm/ldm_fs_ltfs.c

    Phobos-Issue: PHO-129

----------

    doc: update layout design

    Reduce exposed APIs and get rid of GLI.

    - libpho_layout: init/declare/acquire/fini
    - libpho_layout_mod_xxx: {de}register
    - layout implementation: compose/io/commit


----------

    dss: replace layout_type by a module description

    Introduce module description (name, major, minor, attrs) and store it into DSS
    as layout information instead of an empty array. Add the appropriate
    encoding/decoding functions.

    Remove layout_type (and copy_num) which are no longer needed.

    Note that this commit changes the DSS DB schema w/o providing a conversion tool.
    This will come before the next release in order to provide compatibility and
    ease upgrade of existing instances.


----------

    dss: rework json parsing helpers

    Use consistent return values and signed types. Add a couple macro to simplify
    the code.


----------

    dss: use signed integer to represent media stats and extent.

    Unsigned integers are cumbersome and useless here.


----------

    cli: Fix inheritance in DSS object managers

    phobos::dss:MediaManager and phobos::dss:DeviceManager classes operate
    on wrapped objects, although their parent class does not and manipulates
    raw SWIG structures.

    Add the missing ::delete methods appropriately so as to invoke the
    underlying function with the expected argument.


----------

    doc: add a template configuration.

    Add a template configuration with comments.
    Included to the RPM, it is initially installed
    as "/etc/phobos.conf" (if it does not already exists).
    Else it will be installed as /etc/phobos.conf.rpmnew


----------

    doc: Update developer README.

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH must be set with the right postgres version.


----------

    cfg: each module defines its own configuration.

    Configuration variables and default values were previously
    defined in single centralized header. These values are now
    defined independantly by each module. This prepares the
    support of dynamically loaded modules so they can define their
    own parameters.


----------

    cli: Do not emit empty filters

    Prevent the python dss filter converter from emitting empty filters and optimize
    these that only contain a single element.


----------

    scripts: fix typo in comment


----------

    minor release 1.0.1


----------

    ltfs: reduce available media space by 5%.

    LTFS keeps some reserved space to flush its index but do not
    reflect this in statfs().
    The amount of reserved space is not clearly documented, but
    it appears to be around 5% in some real cases.
    So, reduce the free space returned by statfs() on LFTS by 5%.

    This should address one of the aspects of RM#129.


----------

    lrs: mark media full if there is no space free.


----------

    cli: fix minor typo


----------

    doc: layout composition layer

    High-level description of the layout composition layer.
    This will be responsible for managing evoluted layouts (replication,
    erasure coding...) and translating store requests into proper
    sub-requests to the lower layers.


----------

    lrs: mark R/O-mounted media as full

    Mark media as full if operations happen to have failed with -EROFS.
    This can typically occur when LTFS decides that a tape does not contain
    enough space to be mounted writable.


----------

    dss: make dss_unlock return ENOLCK when a lock is not owned.

    When releasing a lock that is not owned by the caller, the resulting
    error code was EEXIST, which was somehow confusing.
    Replace this error by ENOLCK (No lock available).


----------

    dss: make dss_get resilient to missing fields in media stats.

    Commit 4c2b7801 added new fields to media_stats (JSON stored in the DB).

    When running dss_get on a previous phobos DB, these fields are missing.
    Don't break the whole dss_get in that case. Actually make all
    media_stats non-critical. Simply return 0 for the missing ones.
